About me
====== 

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Natural Language Processing working with [Alexander Fraser](https://alexfraser.github.io/) at the Technische Universität München (TUM) Campus Heilbronn.
My work focuses on models and tools for endangered and low-resource languages.
Previously, I was a PhD student at the Université Paris-Saclay (LISN/CNRS laboratory, formerly known as LIMSI) under the supervision of [François Yvon](https://fyvo.github.io/).
My thesis topic was Computational Language Documentation.
