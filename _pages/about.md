About me
====== 

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Natural Language Processing working with [Alexander Fraser](https://alexfraser.github.io/) at TUM Campus Heilbronn.
My work focuses on models and tools for low-resource languages.
Previously, I was a PhD student at Université Paris-Saclay (LISN/CNRS laboratory, formerly known as LIMSI) under the supervision of [François Yvon](https://fyvo.github.io/).
My thesis topic was Computational Language Documentation.

In English, my name is pronounced /ʃuː əʊ'kɑːbeɪ/, in French, /ʃu ɔkabe/, and in Japanese, /okabe ɕɨː/ (order reversed).
